# Bayesian Thompson Sampling Demo

This project demonstrates the application of Bayesian Thompson Sampling for optimizing model selection in production environments, particularly addressing the challenge of model drift.

## Overview

Model drift is a common challenge in machine learning systems where model performance degrades over time due to changes in data distribution. This demo showcases how Thompson Sampling, a Bayesian approach to the multi-armed bandit problem, can be used to dynamically select the best-performing model.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time charts showing model performance and selection probability
- **Bayesian Inference**: Uses Beta distributions to model uncertainty in model performance
- **Adaptive Selection**: Automatically balances exploration and exploitation
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly web interface for experimentation

## Technical Approach

The demo implements Thompson Sampling using:
- Beta-Binomial conjugate priors for efficient Bayesian updates
- Monte Carlo sampling for model selection
- Real-time performance tracking and visualization

## Use Cases

- A/B testing for model deployment
- Online learning systems
- Adaptive model selection in production
- Handling concept drift in ML pipelines

## Future Enhancements

- Support for continuous reward distributions
- Multi-objective optimization
- Integration with MLOps pipelines
