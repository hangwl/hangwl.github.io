# Sample Project

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use MDX files for project content in your TanStack Start portfolio.

## Features

- **Modern Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, and TanStack Router
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on all devices
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized for speed and user experience

## Technical Details

Here's some code to show how you can include syntax highlighting:

```typescript title="hello.ts" caption="hello" showLineNumbers{3}
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

const message = greet("World")
console.log(message)
```

```python
print("Hello World!")

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("World")
print(message)
```


## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern:

1. **Components**: Reusable UI components
2. **Routes**: Page-level components with routing logic
3. **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
4. **Types**: TypeScript type definitions

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: State Management
We needed a lightweight state management solution that wouldn't add unnecessary complexity.

**Solution**: Used React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` for simple state management, avoiding the overhead of external libraries.

### Challenge 2: Performance Optimization
Initial load times were slower than desired.

**Solution**: Implemented code splitting with TanStack Router's built-in lazy loading and optimized bundle sizes.

## Results

- ⚡ **50% faster** load times
- 📱 **100% responsive** across all devices  
- ♿ **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility compliance
- 🚀 **95+ Lighthouse** performance score

## What I Learned

Working on this project taught me valuable lessons about:

- Modern React patterns and best practices
- TypeScript integration in complex applications
- Performance optimization techniques
- User experience design principles

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

- [ ] Add internationalization support
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Explore server-side rendering optimizations
