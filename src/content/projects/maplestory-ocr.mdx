# Game Contributions Extractor

An automated tool for extracting and processing guild contribution data from Maplestory game screenshots using computer vision and OCR technology.

## Problem Statement

Guild leaders in Maplestory needed an efficient way to track member contributions from in-game screenshots. Manual data entry was time-consuming and error-prone, especially with:
- Varying screenshot quality
- Incomplete or partially visible player names (IGNs)
- Different UI layouts and resolutions

## Solution

This project implements an automated pipeline that:

### 1. Image Segmentation
- Analyzes pixel variance patterns to identify contribution rows
- Handles different screenshot resolutions and UI scales
- Robust to varying lighting and color schemes

### 2. OCR Processing
- Uses **PaddleOCR** for text extraction
- Optimized for game UI fonts and styling
- Handles both English and special characters in player names

### 3. Fuzzy Matching
- Implements fuzzy string matching algorithms to handle:
  - Partially visible IGNs
  - OCR errors and misrecognitions
  - Name variations and special characters
- Matches extracted names against known guild member roster

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Core implementation language
- **PaddleOCR**: State-of-the-art OCR engine
- **OpenCV**: Image preprocessing and segmentation
- **FuzzyWuzzy/RapidFuzz**: String similarity matching
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations for pixel analysis

## Key Achievements

- Successfully processed hundreds of contribution screenshots
- Achieved >95% accuracy in contribution extraction
- Reduced manual data entry time by ~90%
- Handled edge cases like overlapping text and UI elements

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Variable Image Quality**: Implemented adaptive preprocessing
2. **Incomplete Text**: Developed robust fuzzy matching with confidence scores
3. **UI Variations**: Created flexible segmentation based on pixel patterns
4. **Performance**: Optimized for batch processing of multiple screenshots

## Impact

This tool significantly improved guild management efficiency, allowing leaders to:
- Quickly track member activity
- Identify inactive members
- Reward top contributors
- Make data-driven decisions about guild operations
