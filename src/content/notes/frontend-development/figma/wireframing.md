## Wireframing Workflow

Since specs aren't confirmed, focus on **Low-Fidelity** (Lo-Fi) wireframes.

1. **Ignore Color**: Use strictly grayscale (Black, White, Gray-300, Gray-600). This keeps the focus on layout, not aesthetics.
2. **Use Kits**: Don't draw every icon. Use a wireframe kit from the Figma Community (e.g., "Wireframe Kit" or "Untitled UI").
3. **Flows**: Connect frames using the **Prototype** tab to show how a user moves from Page A to Page B.

Focus on the user journey and information architecture rather than visual polish at this stage.
