## Developer Mode

When you switch back to coding from Figma:

- **Shortcut**: `Shift + D`.
- **Inspect**: Click any element to see its CSS properties (width, height, background, font).
- **Box Model**: Hover over elements to see margins and padding visually.
- **Export**: Grab SVGs or images directly from selected layers.

Developer Mode bridges the gap between design and implementation, allowing you to extract exact values and assets.
