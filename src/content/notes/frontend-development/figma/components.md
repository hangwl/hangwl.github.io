## Components & Variants

Think of these as your React/Vue components.

- **Component (`Ctrl + Alt + K`)**: The main definition. Copies of this are called "Instances".
- **Variants**: Props for your component.
  - Example: A Button component with a `Type` property (Primary, Secondary) and a `State` property (Default, Hover).
  - You can switch these props on instances using dropdowns in the right sidebar.

Using components ensures consistency across your design and makes updates much easier, as changing the main component updates all instances.
