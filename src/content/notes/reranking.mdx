## Introduction

Reranking is a **post-retrieval process** whereby retrieved documents as reordered using high-performing models to assess their relevance to a given query. 

Typically, rerankers have a **cross-encoder** architecture that may increase the latency of the system. 
However, they can significantly improve the ranking quality of the retrieved documents. 

Alternatively, **LLMs** can also be used as a reranker. 
Although this approach seems increasingly feasible as LLMs become cheaper, it is as inefficient as a cross-encoder model simply because vectors cannot be precomputed.
