## Pricing Models

### 1. Time and Materials (T&M)

**Description:** Client pays for actual time spent at agreed rates.

**Best For:**
- Uncertain scope or evolving requirements
- Discovery and assessment phases
- Ongoing support and maintenance
- Agile delivery with flexible scope

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility for scope changes
- Lower risk for the firm
- Transparent cost tracking

**Considerations:**
- Client budget uncertainty
- Requires detailed time tracking
- May require periodic reconciliation

**Structure:**
```
Total Fee = Σ (Hours × Hourly Rate by Role)
+ Expenses (usually pass-through)
```

---

### 2. Fixed Fee

**Description:** Agreed total price for defined scope and deliverables.

**Best For:**
- Well-defined scope and requirements
- Discrete deliverables
- Client budget constraints
- Competitive bid situations

**Advantages:**
- Budget certainty for client
- Incentive for efficiency
- Simplified billing

**Considerations:**
- Higher risk for the firm if scope changes
- Requires robust change control
- Thorough scoping essential

**Structure:**
```
Fixed Fee = Estimated Effort × Blended Rate + Contingency + Margin
```

---

### 3. Capped Fee / Not-to-Exceed

**Description:** T&M with maximum fee cap.

**Best For:**
- Moderate scope uncertainty
- Client wants some budget protection
- Compromise between T&M and fixed

**Advantages:**
- Client budget ceiling
- Flexibility within cap
- Reduced overrun risk

**Considerations:**
- Cap may limit scope flexibility
- Need clear process for cap extensions

---

### 4. Outcome-Based / Value-Based

**Description:** Fee linked to achievement of specific outcomes or value delivered.

**Best For:**
- Clear, measurable outcomes
- High-value transformations
- Strong client partnership
- Risk-sharing arrangements

**Advantages:**
- Aligns incentives
- Demonstrates confidence
- Potentially higher fees for success

**Considerations:**
- Outcome measurement complexity
- External factors may affect results
- Requires strong governance

**Structure:**
```
Total Fee = Base Fee + Success Fee (if outcomes achieved)
```

## Rate Card Structure

### Standard Rate Categories

| Role | Typical Rate Range (SGD/hour) |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Partner | $500 - $800 |
| Senior Manager | $350 - $500 |
| Manager | $250 - $400 |
| Senior Consultant | $180 - $280 |

## Effort Estimation

### Estimation Approaches

1. **Bottom-Up:** Estimate each task and aggregate
2. **Analogous:** Base on similar past projects
3. **Parametric:** Use metrics (e.g., per data source, per use case)
4. **Expert Judgment:** Leverage team experience

### Estimation Best Practices

- Break work into estimable components
- Use three-point estimates (Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic)
- Include all project phases (planning, execution, QA, PM)
- Account for client dependencies and wait times
- Consider team experience and learning curve
- Build in reasonable contingency

### Contingency Guidelines

| Project Complexity | Suggested Contingency |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Low (well-defined) | 5-10% |
| Medium (some uncertainty) | 10-15% |
| High (significant unknowns) | 15-25% |
| Very High (innovative/experimental) | 25%+ |

---

## Margin Requirements

### Standard Margin Targets

| Engagement Type | Target Margin |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Advisory / Consulting | 25-35% |
| Implementation | 20-30% |
| Managed Services | 15-25% |
| Staff Augmentation | 15-20% |

### Margin Calculation

```
Margin % = (Revenue - Total Cost) / Revenue × 100

Where Total Cost includes:
- Direct labor costs
- Subcontractor costs
- Travel and expenses
- Technology/tools
- Allocated overheads
```

## Pricing Approval Matrix

| Deal Value (SGD) | Approval Required |
|------------------|-------------------|
| < $100,000 | Engagement Partner |
| $100,000 - $500,000 | Engagement Partner + Service Line Leader |
| $500,000 - $2,000,000 | + Market Leader approval |
| > $2,000,000 | + Regional approval |

*Additional approvals required for:*
- Below-standard margins
- Contingent fee arrangements
- Unusual terms or conditions
- High-risk engagements

---

## Discounting Guidelines

### When Discounts May Apply
- Strategic client relationships
- Large deal volume
- Competitive pressure
- Long-term contract commitment
- Bundled services

### Discount Approval
- Discounts >10%: Manager approval
- Discounts >20%: Partner approval
- Discounts >30%: Market Leader approval

## Common Pricing Mistakes

1. **Underestimating effort** - Especially for new technologies
2. **Ignoring overhead** - Project management, QA, documentation
3. **Optimistic assumptions** - Client readiness, data quality
4. **Missing scope items** - Training, support, knowledge transfer
5. **Inadequate contingency** - For unknowns and risks
