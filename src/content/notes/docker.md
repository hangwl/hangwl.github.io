## Introduction

Docker is a platform that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and running applications using containers. **Containers bundle an application** together with its dependencies, such as libraries, frameworks, and environment settings, **into a single portable package that can run reliably across different environments**.

## Why use Docker in MLOps?

In MLOps, Docker is useful for the following reasons:

### Reproducbility

Reproducing machine learning results can often be challenging due to complex environments and dependency issues. Docker containers encapsulate all necessary libraries, dependencies, and configurations required to run an ML model. This ensures consistent behavior across local development, testing, and production environments.

### Isolation

Containers provide strong isolation for ML models, preventing conflicts between different projects or versions. This minimizes issues caused by dependency mismatches and differences in environment setup.

Isolation is important due to:
  - **Resource Allocation**: Each container can be allocated a specific amount of resources, so that we can ensure that each application gets the resources it needs to run without interfering with other applications. 
  - **Version Control**: Containers can be used to run different versions of the same application, or different applications that have conflicting dependencies. This allows us to test and deploy different versions of an application side-by-side, without affecting the other applications.
  - **Security**: Isolating applications in separate containers can help to prevent security breaches. E.g. if one application is compromised, the attacker will be isolated to that container and will not be able to access the host or other containers.
  - **Stability**: If one application crashes or experiences an error, it will not affect the other containers running on the same host. This improves overall system reliability.
  - **Portability**: Containers are lightweight and self-contained. They can be easily moved across machines, environments, or cloud providers.

### Collaboration

Containers simplify collaboration on ML projects by creating consistent, portable environments. Data scientists can focus on developing and testing models inside containers, while IT or DevOps teams can handle deployment, scaling, and monitoring of those containers in production.

### Scalability

Docker makes it straightforward to scale ML models in production. Orchestration tools such as **Kubernetes** can manage clusters of containers. These tools can **automatically scale** the number of running instances up or down **based on demand**, ensuring both efficiency and responsiveness.

## Basic Docker Concepts

### Containers

A container is a **standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software**, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers provide a consistent and isolated environment for applications, which ensure that the application will run the same, regardless of the host system.

### Images

An image is a **blueprint for a Docker container**. It is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package of software that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. An image is built from a set of instructions, called a Dockerfile, which specifies the base image, the application code, and any additional dependencies that are required to run the application. Dockerfiles are used to automate the process of building images, so developers can easily create and modify images as needed.

### Dockerfiles

A Dockerfile is a **script that contains instructions for building a Docker image**. It specifies the base image, the application code, and any additional dependencies that are required to run the application. Dockerfiles are used to automate the process of building images, so developers can easily create and modify images as needed.

### Docker Hub

Docker Hub is Docker's official cloud-based registry. It provides a **public registry for storing and sharing Docker images**, making it easier for developers to access and use images from different sources.

### Volumes

Volumes are a way to **persist data outside of a Docker container**. Volumes can be used to store data that is generated by a container, or to share data between containers. Volumes are stored on the host file system and are managed by Docker.

### Networking

Docker provides a networking layer that allows containers to communicate with each other and the host system. **Docker allows containers to be connected together in a virtual network**, which enables them to communicate with each other using their hostnames. 

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and **running multi-container Docker applications**. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes, and it can be used to start, stop, and manage the application's containers.
