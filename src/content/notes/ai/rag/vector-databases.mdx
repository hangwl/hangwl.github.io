## Introduction

Vector databases are databases **optimized to store and search through huge quantities of high-dimensional vector data**. 
Some may also be optimized for tasks like building proximity graphs that enable fast approximate nearest neighbor searches. 

**Weaviate** is a popular open-source vector database that can be run both locally or in the cloud.

## Typical Vector Database Operations

Typically, vector database include the following operations:

- Database Setup
- Document Loading
- Insertion of sparse vectors for keyword search
- Insertion of dense vectors for semantic search
- Generation of Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index for approximate nearest neighbor search
- Document Search
