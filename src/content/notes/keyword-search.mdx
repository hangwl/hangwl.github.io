## Introduction

The core idea of keyword search is to match documents with keywords found in a query prompt. 
As a part of this process, both prompts and documents are converted into sparse vectors that count how often each word in a system's vocabulary appears in that piece of text. 
Each document is then scored based on the presence of these keywords, and the documents are ranked based on their scores.

## BM25 (Best Matching 25)

BM25 (Best Matching 25) is the standard keyword search algorithm for in-production retrievers. It improvements TF-IDF, and offers better performance and flexibility at a similar cost.
